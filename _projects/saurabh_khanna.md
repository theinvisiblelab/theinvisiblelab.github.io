Saurabh is an assistant professor of communication science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/s.khanna/s.khanna.html) and a research associate at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). His research is aimed at quantifying the diversity and limits of human knowledge in an increasingly digitized world. Ongoing projects include:

- developing methods to quantify diversity and incompleteness in digital information
- studying diversity in entertainment media using IMDb and MovieDb corpora
- studying diversity in global occupation imagery using Google Images and ILO reports
- scientometric analyses of communication and media studies
- 'misinfotainment' and the blurring lines between political and entertainment communication

Saurabh received my PhD in education policy (minor in computer science) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where he was a Human-centered AI Fellow, a Stanford Data Science Scholar, and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow. His prior background spans computer science engineering (BITS Pilani), economics (Stanford), and education (TISS). More
